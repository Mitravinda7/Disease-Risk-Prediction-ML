# Disease-Risk-Prediction-ML
Regression-based machine learning project for disease risk prediction

This project focuses on building a regression-based machine learning model to predict disease risk using patient health data.

Planned Workflow:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Train-test split
- Training regression models
- Model evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE
- Visualization of predicted vs actual values

Tech Stack:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
