# Disease Risk Prediction — Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting disease progression risk using a regression-based machine learning approach.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can predict disease progression based on multiple health-related features.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the built-in diabetes dataset in scikit-learn, which contains numeric health-related features and a continuous target variable representing disease progression.

## Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature-target separation
4. Train-test split
5. Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
6. Model evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE
7. Model comparison
8. Visualization of predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run

Open the notebook file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.



## Results
Random Forest regression performed better compared to Linear Regression based on evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data understanding to model evaluation using regression techniques.
